## Properties

### flowId

â€¢ `Optional` **flowId**: `string`

The identifier of the "flow" on which this message was outputted. This is
to support parsers in order to understand situations where multiple
parallel executions are outputting to a single stream. Leaving it undefined
equates to the message being in the "root" flow.
